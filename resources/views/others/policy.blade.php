                        using the Alkebulan-Eca app. <br>
                        <b>1. What type of personal data we collect and process</b><br>
                        Name, telephone number, e-mail address, feedback ratings and/or

                        the destination;
                        Identification data of the device on which the Alkebulan-Eca app has been
                        installed;

                        geographic location data and other available web browsing data. <br>
                        <b> 2. The purpose of collecting and the period of processing of
                            personal data </b><br>
                        We collect and process personal data for the purpose of matching up
                        a user with a driver;
                        We forward the data on geographical location and telephone number
                        of the user to the driver to enable us decide whether the user is
                        located nearby;
                        We may use the personal data to resolve driverÂ´s service quality
                        issues;
                        We use contact details to notify you of updates to the Alkebulan-Eca app;
                        We collect data of the routes taken by the Alkebulan-Eca app users to
                        analyse the geographic coverage in order to make recommendations
                        to the drivers.
                        We may use your data for advertising and marketing purposes,
                        including sending electronic commercial communications for services
                        that we, our parent company, and our business partners may offer
                        you. <br>
                        <b>3. The method of collecting personal data</b><br>
                        We collect data on the names, telephone numbers and/or e-mail
                        addresses of Gozem app users during the process of the installation
                        of the Gozem app;
                        We only collect data on the geographic location if the Gozem app has
                        been activated;
                        The collection of geographic location data stops after the Gozem app
                        is closed in the user's device. <br>
                        <b>4. Disclosure of personal data to third parties</b><br>
                        The personal data of users is only disclosed to those drivers who
                        have activated the Gozem app; in such case, they will see the name,
                        telephone number and geographic location of the user;
                        After providing the service, the name of the user may remain visible
                        to the driver. This is necessary for drivers to resolve any issues
                        associated with service provision, e.g., to contact the user if an item
                        was left behind in the car;
                        The feedback on the quality of the service is anonymous and drivers
                        do not receive information on the names and telephone numbers of
                        the users who provided feedback;
                        We may disclose your personal data to service providers for the
                        purposes set out in this privacy policy;
                        We may transfer your personal data for commercial and direct
                        marketing purposes to business partners or affiliates;
                        Depending on the location of the user, the personal data may be
                        handed over to the relevant local entities providing Alkebulan-Eca app
                        services. Any collection and processing of personal data by local
                        Alkebulan-Eca service providers shall occur under the same conditions as
                        established in this privacy policy.
                        We shall be entitled to disclose your personal data if we are required
                        by any regulatory body or Government authority or official or any
                        security agency for the purposes of conducting an investigation into
                        an alleged crime. <br>
                        <b>5. Security and deletion of data</b><br>
                        Any personal data collected in the course of providing the Alkebulan-Eca
                        service is transferred to and stored in the data centres located in the
                        territory of England. Only authorised employees of Alkebulan-Eca and local
                        service providers have access to the personal data and they may
                        access the data only for the purpose of resolving issues associated
                        with the use of the Alkebulan-Eca app (including disputes with the drivers);
                        Alkebulan-Eca takes all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality
                        and security of the personal data processed and to prevent
                        tampering, corruption or access by unauthorized persons.
                        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not
                        completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal
                        data, we can not guarantee the security of your data transmitted to
                        our sites. Once we have received your information, we will seek to
                        prevent unauthorized access, using strict procedures and security
                        features.
                        Please note that uninstalling the Alkebulan-Eca app from your device does
                        not terminate your account and therefore does not delete your
                        personal data. If you wish to delete your personal data collected by
                        Alkebulan-Eca, please send a written request to close your account and
                        delete the personal data by e-mail. Keep in mind that the request to
                        delete personal data is only possible if we delete your account. As a
                        result, you will no longer be able to use Alkebulan-Eca services under your
                        existing account. After the deletion, the personal data will be
                        anonymized and used for analytics only.
                        If you presume that we (or any other Alkebulan-Eca entity processing your
                        personal data) carry such processing in contradiction with your
                        personal rights or in contradiction with the law, in particular if the
                        personal data is inaccurate, you may:<br>
                        a) ask us (and/or any other Alkebulan-Eca entity processing your
                        personal data) for an explanation;<br>
                        b) require us (and/or any other Alkebulan-Eca entity processing your
                        personal data) to remedy the arisen state of affairs (in particular
                        by blocking, correction or supplementing of personal data);<br>
                        c) appeal directly to the respective data protection authority
                        having the jurisdiction over your personal data. <br>
                        <b>Direct marketing</b><br>
                        We may use your e-mail address and phone number for sharing our
                        product related marketing messages. If you no longer wish to receive
